    <h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
    <div id="content">
    <p>Thanks for downloading Baby SweetTooth.  We tried to make this as painless as possible, so read on to get your new theme set up.</p>
<div id="contentpage">
	<h2>Step 1 - Install the theme</h2>
    <p>Upload the contents of the zip file to your <tt>/wp-content/themes/</tt> directory.  Once the files are uploaded, you can click the Change Theme button from the Dashboard or expand the Appearance section in the sidebar and click on Themes.  Then click Activate underneath the Baby SweetTooth image and description.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px;"><img src="screenshot.png" width="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It will look like this.</p></div>    
	<h2>Step 2 - Set the options</h2>
    <p>If you are looking at your site after activating the theme, it should be telling you what you need to do next, namely, set the theme options.  This is done under Appearance in Baby SweetTooth Options.  The required field to make the message go away is to set the category from which the Featured Post will pull.  Case isn't sensitive.  This can just be your default Uncategorized category, or you can create a category called Featured and push all those posts to that area.  You can also specify an image to display above the featured post (though this is not required).  There are also 3 other categories you can set for more category-specific feeds.  These won't display if you don't set them, but you lose most of the benefit of this theme if you don't use them, so we recommend setting those up, too.  You can also add your FeedBurner ID (follow the link from the theme options page to learn how to get this) and a video embed code to display in the sidebar.  The sidebars are all widgetized, too, so when you're done here, you can add more widgets to your sidebar(s) and watch them show up on the site.</p>
    <p>There's also room to add 3 small, 117px square images in the header.  these will automatically be placed in their respective boxes, all <em>you</em> need to do is tell the theme where they're located.  It's recommended that the images be sized to 117 pixels square -- while it's possible to use larger images, it could slow down the site and look weird.</p>
    <h2>Step 3 - Set up the menus</h2>
    <p>WordPress 3.0 gives us the power to create customized nav menus, so we've added that to this theme as well.  Use the built-in menu editor under Appearance to change the page links that appear above the content.
    <h2>Step 4 - Tell your friends!</h2>
    <p>You're ready to use your theme.  You can always go back to the theme options page to change things around or swap out pictures.  We recommend using WordPress' Media Library to upload files and then using that to copy the image path you need for Baby SweetTooth's options, but if you're familiar enough with FTP, that may be easier.</p>
